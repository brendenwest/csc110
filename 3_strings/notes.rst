**Summary**

* String variables
* Strings as sequences
* String operations
* Character encoding
* String methods
* String formatting
* File processing

**String variables**

* Text is represented by the String data type
* Strings are delimited by quotes or apostrophes - e.g. ‘This is text’
* Quotes in text are escaped with \ - e.g. 'We\re excited'
* Strings are case sensitive
* Python input() command returns a string by default::

    phrase = input("enter a phrase: ")

**Strings as sequences**

* Strings are sequences of characters. Individual characters can be accessed by zero-based index #:
::

    >>> name = 'james'
    >>> name[0]
    'j'

* The last character of a string has an index of length-1
* len(<string>) returns the number of characters in the string
::

    >>> len(name)
    5

 
**Substrings**
 
* Substrings can be accessed by ‘slicing’ with this basic syntax:
::

    <string>[<start>:<end>]

For example:
::

    >>> name[1:3]
    'am'

* the substring contains characters up to but NOT including 'end' number
* If either expression is omitted, the start or end of the string is used
::

    >>> name[:3]
    'jam'
    >>> name[2:]
    'mes'
 

**Concatenation** - Strings can be combined with +
::

    >>> 'spam' + 'eggs'
    'spameggs'

**Repetition** - Strings can be repeated with *
::

    >>> 3*'spam'
    'spamspamspam'

**Membership** - Python provides a simple way to check if a string contains another string:
::

    >>> name = 'james'
    >>> 'Z' in name  # returns False because 'james' doesn't contain 'Z'

**String methods** - Python provides many string-specific methods:

* s.upper()
::

    >>> name = 'Bart'
    >>> name.upper()
    BART

* s.lower()
::

    >>> name.lower()
    bart

* s.replace(<sub1>,<sub2>) - replace occurrences of <sub1> with <sub2>
::

    >>> bart.replace(‘t,’b’)
    Barb

* s.count(<sub>) - count occurrences of <sub> in string s
* s.find(<sub>) - return the first position of <sub> in string s
* s.join([<sub>, <sub>]) - join a list of substrings, using string s as separator
* s.split(<sub>) - split string s into a list of substrings based on <sub>
::

    sentence = 'the quick brown fox'
    sentence.split() # splits on spaces by default
    print(words) # prints [‘the’, ‘quick’, ‘brown’, ‘fox’]

    for w in words:
      print(w) # prints each word in list

**Iteration** - You can iterate through the characters in a string with a loop: 
::

    for ch in 'class':
       print(ch, end=" ") # prints each character followed by a space


**Character encoding**

* ASCII - most common latin characters & symbols
* UTF-8 - support for nearly all characters in all languages
* Control characters - special characters that control computer behavior (e.g. tabs, spaces, carriage returns, etc.)
* chr(<int>) - returns character associated with the number
::

    >>> chr(65)
    'A'

* ord(<str>) - returns number associated with the character
::

    >>> ord('A')
    65

**String Formatting**

Strings can be formatted with a ‘template’ string that has placeholders into which values are inserted:

    <template-string>.format(<values>)
::

    "Hi. My name is {0} and I like {1}".format('Dave', 'baseball')

* Placeholders have an index number that tells which value to insert,
* Placeholders can include a format specifier for how the value should be displayed.
* Format specifier has the form:

    <width>.<precision><type>

    - Width tells how may spaces to occupy and precision indicates # of decimal places. For example, the below statement formats ‘total’ value to 2 decimal places:
::

    print("Total price is {0:0.2f}".format(total))


**File processing**
 
* Files are large strings
* Lines in files are separated by newline ( \n ) characters
* After completing read/write operations, the file should be closed
* Files must be opened before programs can read from or write to them:

    <filevar> = open(<filename>, <mode>)
::

    myFile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')

**Note** - file name must include it's location relative to the current python program, or an absolute file path. The above example assumes both program and text file are in the same directory.

* Reading: after opening a file, you can read file contents with several different commands:
    - file.read() - reads **entire** file into a string
    - file.readlines() - returns a **list** of all lines in the file
    - file.readline() - reads the next line as a string. Moves ‘pointer’ so subsequent commands operate only on remaining lines.
    
Programs can iterate through all lines in a file:
::

    inFile = open(‘myfile.txt’, ‘r’)
    for line in inFile.readlines():
        print(line)
    inFile.close()

* Writing
    - Opening a file for writing prepares it to receive data. It creates a file if one doesn’t exist, and overwrites any existing file contents:
::

    outfile = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
    print(<expression>, file=outfile)
    outfile.close()
