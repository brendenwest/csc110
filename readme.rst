CSC 110 - Intro to Programming with Python
----

**Class Details**

* Location: BE 3175
* Time: T,TH 3:00 - 5:30 pm
* Dates:  9/24/2019 - 12/11/2019
* Instructor: Brenden West | brenden.west@seattlecolleges.edu | 206-552-9795
* Credits: 5
* Prerequisites: MAT 98 (Intermediate Algebra) with 2.0 or better

**Summary**

This class introduces basic concepts and techniques of computer science & programming with practical exercises using the Python programming language. Students will learn to: 

* Create expressions that use data variables, arithmetic, and logical operators
* Use conditional statements, loops, functions & objects 
* Use proper syntax and design guidelines when writing a computer program
* Apply programming concepts to solve a variety of logical problems

**Required Materials**

Readings will draw from http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/ and http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/. A hardcopy of Think Python is optional, but an excellent reference with exercises and chapter summaries.

Students will also need the following:

* A computer with Python 3.6 or later installed 
* A modern, syntax-highlighting text editor such as Sublime Text, Brackets, Komodo Edit, 
* A user account at https://repl.it/

Note - 
* Students can download `these interactive class notes<https://github.com/brendenwest/csc110/blob/master/csc110.ipynb>`_. and upload to https://colab.research.google.com to run them
* Students can use a free online Python coding environment such as https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/ or https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ rather than configure their own computer.

**Class Structure and Topics**

Each week, we'll cover a different topic, building on the previous week's work. In general, we will cover new material in Tuesday lectures and use Wednesday labs to practice what youâ€™ve learned. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

#. Computer Science, Programming, Setting up Python
#. Basics of Python programs
#. Computing with numbers 
#. Strings & file I/O
#. Conditional statements & logical operators
#. Loops
#. Functions
#. Data collections
#. Objects & classes
#. Graphics
#. Plotting data

**Grading**

Grades will be based on weekly assignments (80%), 3 quizzes (15%), and class participation (5%).

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas each Wednesday and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the start of class on the following Monday, and late assignments may be automatically marked down by 10%.   

You may discuss how to approach a problem with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.

**ADA Accessibility**

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the Disability Support Services office (DSS) in Rm. BE 1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS you will be given a letter of accommodation to be handed to your instructor.
